# DoubleNote

This package is the all-features-included version of [DoubleNote](https://github.com/Bernd-L/DoubleNote#readme).

It combines the functionality of both the [DoubleNote frontend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/doublenote-frontend), as well as the functionality of the [DoubleNote backend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/doublenote-backend).

It is possible to run the frontend as a stand-alone web-app using static serving (like a CDN).  
The backend requires Node.js to work.

## Usage

You can install DoubleNote globally, or run it using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

1. Run DoubleNote using `npx`
   1. Install `npx` (if you haven't done so already) with `npm i npx -g`
   2. Start DoubleNote using `npx doublenote`
2. Install DoubleNote globally using npm
   1. Run `npm i doublenote -g` to install DoubleNote globally
   2. Start DoubleNote using `dn` or `doublenote`

This application is also available as a Docker image at <https://hub.docker.com/r/berndl/doublenote>.
