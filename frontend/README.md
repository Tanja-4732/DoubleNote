# DoubleNote Frontend

This is the Frontend of DoubleNote.

It's an [Angular](https://angular.io) single page application written in TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS.

The goal of the frontend is to provide a full-featured web application capable of creating, editing, and view notes -- both in Markdown and as free-hand drawings.

## Implementation strategy

This is how I envision DoubleNote to be implemented

- Provide a sidenav to switch between contexts such as the welcome screen, settings and notebooks
- Use RxJS Observables and Subjects where possible
- Use event-sourcing (CQRS)
- Represent any action as an event as soon as possible
- Connect to users via WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication
  - Use the PeerJS library
- Send every event to all peers as soon as possible
- Treat own events the same way as incoming events from peers
- Only update the state of a note by applying events
- Maybe implement something like Git?
  - Objects
  - Hashes
  - Branches
  - Push/Pull

## 2nd iteration

- Real-time collaboration requires one peer to be the host
- Every action performed by any user needs to be an event
- Pipe every event through the same pipeline
- Treat own events the same way as incoming events from peers
- Allow users to undo and redo any changes made during editing
- Commit after changes are completed
