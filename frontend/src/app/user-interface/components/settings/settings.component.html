  <h1>
    Check for updates
  </h1>

  <p>
    This application is currently on the version {{ version }}. <br />
    Updates are automatically installed once they are available, which usually
    happens roughly ten seconds after the application has finished loading. The
    button below will check for updates and download them if they are available.
    <br />
    Once the text directly above the button changes to "Checked for updates."
    the check has completed. If updates were found (and their download has been
    completed) a snack bar will appear with a reload button. <br />
    The application will automatically check for updates (and download them if
    possible) every time it's opened. This is why you might see the "Updates
    available" snack bar roughly ten seconds after opening the application.

  <button mat-raised-button color="warn" (click)="deleteAll()">
