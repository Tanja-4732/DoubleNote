# DoubleNote

A note taking app focused on ease of use and user freedom.

This is a new project (currently in beta); its development status is far away from a 1.0 release.

To give it a try, see the `master` branch deployed here: <https://DoubleNote.tanja.pw/> (powered by CloudFlare pages).  
Notice: This is only the frontend served statically. Some (planned) features are only available using the backend server.

## (Planned) Features

_See the newest plans in the [5th iteration of the frontend README](/frontend/README.md#5th-iteration)_

- Note-taking with both Markdown and WYSIWYG editors (ProseMirror)
- Full offline support (Progressive Web App)
- Peer-to-peer real-time collaboration (WebRTC, no backend server needed)
- Git-like version control (commits, branches, tags, reused objects)
- Two types of notebooks
  - Recursive categories with pages containing text boxes and free-hand drawing (like OneNote)
  - Sequential blocks with nested pages capable of special data and tables (like Notion)
- Offline-capable import/export functionality (JSON)
- Origin-agnostic migration support (for DoubleNote instances on different hosts)
- Optional cloud storage (server-side software) with user accounts and shared permissions

## Usage

If you want to try the application before installing via NPM or Docker, you can check it out [here on CloudFlare Pages](https://DoubleNote.tanja.pw/).

Both the frontend and the backend have their respective packages on NPM: [doublenote-frontend](https://npmjs.org/package/doublenote-frontend) (contains the compiled frontend without any non-dev dependencies), and the [doublenote-backend](https://npmjs.org/package/doublenote-backend), which contains the compiled backend (depending on Express).

## Development

For more information on how to develop this application, push it beyond its current capabilities and realize your own features and/or bug fixes, see the [development section of the frontend README.md](/frontend/README.md#development)
